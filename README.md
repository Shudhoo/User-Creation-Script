# User_Creation_Script

This script helps you quickly create a new user on a Linux system.
Instead of adding users manually, you just run the script and give two things:

- The username

- A short comment or description (like the userâ€™s role)

The script then:

- Creates the user

- Sets a random password

- Prints the username and password for you

It saves time and avoids typing all the commands manually.


## How to Run Script

```bash
  ./creat_user.sh <USERNSME> <"Sr.Dev">
```
Example -
```bash
  ./creat_user.sh Ram "Sr.Dev"
```


    
## Lessons Learned

My understanding of Linux has helped me automate small, repetitive tasks using shell scripts. By learning how the command line works and how to write basic scripts, I can now create tools that save time and reduce manual effort. This has improved my efficiency and made everyday system tasks much easier to handle.
